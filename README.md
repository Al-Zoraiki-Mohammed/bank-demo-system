# Bank-System-Demo
* This project is a simple command-line bank system application built with Python. The primary goal of this project is to practice coding, enhance problem-solving skills, and understand basic concepts of software development, such as data management, user interaction, and modular programming.

## Features
- Client Management: Add, update, delete, and search for client accounts.
- Transaction System: Perform deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries.
- Data Persistence: Client data is saved for future sessions using simple file I/O.
** Key Concepts
- Modular Design: The system is broken into logical functions for better readability and maintainability.
Interactive User Interface: The command-line interface allows users to interact with the system using a simple menu.
- Data Handling: The system reads and writes client data from/to a file to simulate a database.
## Assumptions & Notes
- Input Validation: For simplicity, input validation is minimal. Users must follow the prompts carefully to avoid errors.
- Account Uniqueness: Each client account number must be unique.
- Currency Format: Balances are stored as strings with a currency symbol (e.g., "100$").
- Simplified Design: This is a learning project, so many real-world complexities (like authentication and error handling) are omitted.
* This project serves as a practical learning tool for mastering Python concepts and exploring the development of small-scale systems.
